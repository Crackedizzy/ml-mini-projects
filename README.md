# 🧠 Machine Learning Mini Projects

This repository contains selected workshop notebooks from my university coursework in machine learning. Each notebook focuses on applying core ML concepts such as model building, evaluation, and comparison using real-world datasets.

These workshops reflect hands-on learning and showcase the progression of my skills across classification tasks, metric interpretation, and supervised learning pipelines.

## 📊 Contents

### 🔹 Workshop 10 – Classification Models & Evaluation
- Task: Compare multiple classification models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Techniques: Train/test split, confusion matrix, classification report
- Dataset: CSV dataset provided during module workshop (uploaded or referenced inside notebook)

### 🔹 Workshop 11 – Supervised Learning
- Task: Build and tune basic machine learning models for a classification problem
- Techniques: Model fitting, basic parameter tuning, metric tracking
- Dataset: UCI-like tabular dataset (included or linked within notebook)

## 📦 Datasets

The datasets used in these workshops were provided as part of university lab sessions.  
Where possible, datasets have been embedded or linked directly inside each notebook.  
If a dataset is not included for licensing reasons, instructions are provided inside the notebook for how to obtain it.
